# Raman1708-Automated-Smart-Medicine-Dispenser

MOTIVATION

This project idea is an innovative approach to solving real-life problems. As we all know product development is a must in today’s world in order to keep up with the fast-paced growth and the challenges that arise during the progress. One of the common problems faced by old people in India and also all over the world is health issues. There are multiple medical prescriptions which creates a state of confusion and sort of stress development for them to follow the schedule from time to time without any hindrance. The main problem that arises in this is that the number of medicines is usually more than one or two and often the timely intake is not followed. Our project is oriented toward this issue and aims to solve the problem of overcoming the hardships faced by the aged.

CHALLENGES

Setup Box: The selection of the box which will be our core setup of the project was not an easy task. Finding the correct dimensioning and proper division of sections was a challenge.
Material: The covering of the sections of our setup box required a flexible material. The challenge was to find the material having the proper thickness.
Assembly: The setup of individual components in the setup box was a challenge as proper size and space were not peculiar with respect to each component. The adjustment was required to assemble the project.
Mechanism: The mechanism for opening the divided sections created an issue. The challenge was the proper and smooth opening which wasn’t the case.
Debugging: The Arduino code showed a compilation error. Identifying the error and removing the bug was a challenge.
Power: The challenge was to find the accurate power required to function the components in the project. The power selection was important as more power could have damaged the instruments and less power would not work.



WORK METHODOLOGY

This medical box is useful in day-to-day life for those who are not able to remember when to take their medicines. Here is the working of it:

Organized Compartments: The dispenser features several individual sections, each designated for a specific medication.  These compartments are hidden behind a layer of cardboard covers.

Precise Delivery:  Attached to each compartment cover is a tiny motor called a servo motor.  Controlled by a small computer (Arduino), these motors precisely open and close the designated cover when it's time for your medication.
Internal Clock Keeper:  A built-in timekeeping module ensures the dispenser operates on a precise schedule.  You program the dispense times for each medication, and the dispenser takes care of the rest.
Visual and Audible Reminders: Don't miss a dose! A bright LED light illuminates when it's medication time. Additionally, a beeper sounds an alert, further ensuring you won't forget your important medication.
Rechargeable Power:  The dispenser is powered by rechargeable batteries, eliminating the need for frequent battery changes. Simply recharge the batteries periodically for continued operation.

Customization: The design is adaptable to fit your needs. The number of medication sections can be adjusted, and the dispense schedule can be programmed for each medication individually.

Temperature Module: Considering the regular indications on medications regarding storing in cool and dry place under appropriate conditions, we have installed temperature module too for keeping the specific medicines fine.


CONCLUSION OF PROJECT

This automated dispenser offers a convenient and reliable solution for managing medication routines. It promotes medication adherence, provides peace of mind, and simplifies medication management, especially for those with busy schedules or memory problems.

Improved Medication: Studies show that medication dispensers can significantly increase medication adherence, which can lead to better health outcomes. By ensuring timely and accurate intake of medicines, the dispenser helps avoid missed medications and potential complications.


Reduced Risk of Errors: Manual medication management can be prone to errors, especially for individuals with multiple medications or complex schedules. This dispenser eliminates the risk of accidentally taking the wrong medication or dosage.


Enhanced Caregiver Support: For caregivers managing medications for loved ones, this dispenser can provide valuable assistance. It reduces the burden of remembering and administering medications, offering peace of mind and increased confidence in caregiving routines.


Potential Cost Savings: Improved medication adherence can lead to reduced healthcare costs because of with missed doses or medication complications. 

Future Development: Having scope of development further in the future with some of the proposals like integrating and coordinating it with a software application for smooth functioning.
