# Automated Smart Medicine Dispenser
## Overview
The Automated Smart Medicine Dispenser is an Arduino-based device designed to simplify and ensure accurate medication management, especially for elderly users or those memory challenges. It features individually controlled compartments, visual and audible reminders, programmable schedules, and environmental monitoring to maintain optimal storage conditions.

## Motivation

Managing multiple medications on strict schedules poses challenges and stress—especially for seniors. Missed or incorrect doses can lead to health complications. This project automates dispensing, reduces human error, and promotes adherence, offering peace of mind to users and caregivers alike.

## Features

- Programmable Dispense Schedule

- Individual Compartments with servo-controlled lids

- Real-Time Clock (RTC) for precise timing

- Visual (LED) and Audible (Buzzer) reminders

- Temperature Monitoring to ensure proper storage

- Rechargeable Battery Power for portability

- Modular Design—adjustable number of compartments

## Hardware Specifications

- Microcontroller: ATmega328 @ 16 MHz, 5 V logic

- RTC Accuracy: ±2 ppm (DS3231)

- Servo Torque: ~1.8 kg·cm

- Buzzer Voltage: 12 V DC

- Battery Pack: 37 V nominal (10×3.7 V), capacity as per runtime requirement

- Operating Temperature Range: 0 °C – 50 °C

## Mechanical Assembly

### 1.Enclosure Preparation
  - Divide the box into compartments sized for daily doses.

  - Install servo motors beneath each lid section.

### 2.Mounting Components

  - Fix Arduino, RTC, and LCD onto the rear panel.

  - Secure battery pack and rocker switch inside.

### 3.Wiring Harness

  - Route servo signal wires and power lines neatly.

  - Connect temperature sensor to an analog input.

### 4.Cover Layer

  - Affix thin cardboard or acrylic lids onto servo output horns via gears.

## Conclusion of the project

  - This automated dispenser offers a convenient and reliable solution for managing medication routines. It promotes medication adherence, provides peace of mind, and            simplifies medication management, especially for those with busy schedules or memory problems.

  - Improved Medication: Studies show that medication dispensers can significantly increase medication adherence, which can lead to better health outcomes. By ensuring           timely and accurate intake of medicines, the dispenser helps avoid missed medications and potential complications.


  - Reduced Risk of Errors: Manual medication management can be prone to errors, especially for individuals with multiple medications or complex schedules. This dispenser        eliminates the risk of accidentally taking the wrong medication or dosage.


  - Enhanced Caregiver Support: For caregivers managing medications for loved ones, this dispenser can provide valuable assistance. It reduces the burden of remembering and      administering medications, offering peace of mind and increased confidence in caregiving routines.

   
  - Potential Cost Savings: Improved medication adherence can lead to reduced healthcare costs because of with missed doses or medication complications. 


  - Future Development: Having scope of development further in the future with some of the proposals like integrating and coordinating it with a software application for         smooth functioning.
